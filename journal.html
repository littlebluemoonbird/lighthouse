    <p>My molars shattered into pieces in my dreams last night. The pain was so sharp and real, I woke up screeching.

<p> When happiness happens, it can be more troubling than comforting. It feels like something isn't quite right. It almost implies an end, a kind of death. For some of us, happiness doesn't always feel like home. Our preference seems to be the strange paradoxical comfort of misery's discomfort, the soothing darkness of melancholy, and the striving agitation of discontent. How can we be so intelligent, aware, and well-equipped and at the same time be so unhappy, unaware of the “why?” and we can’t do anything about it. Or we don’t know what to do about it.

<p> The sense of camaraderie I feel with other cyclists on a dead winter day like today… Winter riding is a different kind of fun, but it takes a lot more time to get ready and to get undressed. The key is to get out the door. Work up to a good cadence, warm up the joints, and then the cold doesn’t feel so cold anymore.  But the worst is when I get the Raynaud’s in my fingers and toes.. (sometimes in my nipples too?!), now THAT really sucks since I can't really do much except to cycle faster. At this point, it's all about <s>survival</s> raising the body temperature.
