I think the biggest lesson I've learned is that it's okay to be kind. It's okay to be friends with people. It's okay to be there for people. And it's okay to be a good person.

    Violence only creates more violence. It begets more anger, more hatred, and more pain. It destroys relationships and creates mistrust...

    <p>I've been told that life is full of ups and downs, and that's definitely true. But what I'm finding is that it's also full of a lot of gray areas. It's hard to know what the right thing to do is, and even harder to do it. They say this is part of growing up. But there are times when I wish I had some kind of roadmap to help me figure out where I'm supposed to be.

<p> When happiness happens, it can be more troubling than comforting. It feels like something isn't quite right. It almost implies an end, a kind of death. For some of us, happiness doesn't always feel like home. Our preference seems to be the strange paradoxical comfort of misery's discomfort, the soothing darkness of melancholy, and the striving agitation of discontent. How can we be so intelligent, aware, and well-equipped and at the same time be so unhappy, unaware of the “why?” and we can’t do anything about it. Or we don’t know what to do about it..

<p> The choices we make in life reflect who we are and what we believe. In what we choose to do with our time, we make a statement about our priorities. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the music we listen to - all of these things say something about us. Some people believe that we have free will and can make our own choices, while others believe that our choices are predetermined by outside forces... 
    <br><br>    
    If we believe that we have free will, then we can take comfort in the fact that we are in control of our lives and our destiny. 
    <br><br>     
    If we believe that our choices are predetermined, then we must accept the fact that we are not in control and that there is a greater power at work. 
    <br><br>     
    Either way, we need to live with the choices we make and the consequences that come with them...

    I woke up on the wrong side of the bed and my day went downhill from there. To make matters worse, we got into a huge fight, something that hasn't happened in a while. At one point, we were both screaming and saying hurtful things to each other. The walls were caving in on me. I wanted to hide but my body refused to listen to my mind and my blood continued to boil.. Until I saw her cry, and I felt my own tears start to fall, extinguishing our fires, anger simmered down.. I wanted to say something, anything to make it better, but I couldn't find the words. We just stood there, crying and feeling the pain of our choices. 
    <br><br>
    Today, we chose violence. But for what reason? Only to succumb to a wave of silence, our empty eyes locked together. We both knew that one of us had to get up and break this moment. At one point, we'll have to return to our friends and family, the society, the mundane, but this time, with open wounds.

    I'm not sure if I should be writing this down. It feels like a secret, like something I shouldn't share. But maybe that's why I need to. I need to get it out, to tell someone, even if that someone is just the pages of this journal.
